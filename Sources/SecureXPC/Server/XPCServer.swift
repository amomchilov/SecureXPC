/// An XPC server to receive requests from and send responses to an ``XPCClient``.
///
/// ### Retrieving a Server
/// There are two different types of services you can retrieve a server for: XPC Services and XPC Mach services. If you're uncertain which type of service you're
/// using, it's likely an XPC Service.
///
/// #### XPC Services
/// These are helper tools which ship as part of your app and only your app can communicate with.
///
/// To retrieve a server for an XPC Service:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisXPCService()
/// ```
///
/// #### XPC Mach services
///
/// Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, and helper tools installed with
/// [`SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless) can optionally communicate
/// over XPC by using Mach services.
///
/// In most cases, a server can be auto-configured for a helper tool installed with `SMJobBless`:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisBlessedHelperTool()
/// ```
/// See ``XPCServer/forThisBlessedHelperTool()`` for the exact requirements which need to be met.
///
/// For Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, more advanced `SMJobBless` helper tool configurations, as well as other cases it is necessary both to the specify the
/// name of the service as well its security requirements. See ``XPCServer/forThisMachService(named:clientRequirements:)`` for an example and
/// details.
///
/// **Requirement Checking**
///
/// SecureXPC requires that a server for an XPC Mach service provide code signing requirements which define which clients are allowed to talk to it.
///
/// On macOS 11 and later, requirement checking uses publicly documented APIs. On older versions of macOS, the private undocumented API
/// `void xpc_connection_get_audit_token(xpc_connection_t, audit_token_t *)` will be used; if for some reason the function is unavailable
/// then no messages will be accepted. When messages are not accepted, if the ``XPCServer/errorHandler`` is set then it is called
/// with ``XPCError/insecure``.
///
///
/// ### Registering & Handling Routes
/// Once a server instance has been retrieved, one or more routes should be registered with it. This is done by calling one of the `registerRoute` functions and
/// providing a route and a compatible closure or function. For example:
/// ```swift
///     ...
///     let updateConfigRoute = XPCRouteWithMessageWithReply("update", "config",
///                                                          messageType:Config.self,
///                                                          replyType: Config.self)
///     server.registerRoute(updateConfigRoute, handler: updateConfig)
/// }
///
/// private func updateConfig(_ config: Config) throws -> Config {
///     <# implementation here #>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If the function or closure provided as the `handler` parameter throws an error and the route expects a return, then ``XPCError/other(_:)`` will be
/// returned to the client with the `String` associated type describing the thrown error. It is intentional the thrown error is not marshalled as that type may not be
/// `Codable` and may not exist in the client.
///
/// ### Starting a Server
/// Once all of the routes are registered, the server must be told to start processing requests. In most cases this should be done with:
/// ```swift
/// server.startAndBlock()
/// ```
///
/// Returned server instances which conform to ``NonBlockingStartable`` can also be started in a non-blocking manner:
/// ```swift
/// server.start()
/// ```
